### Calgames 2018 Systems Design Award Presentation Statement

" Presented by Camp Peavy, Neato Robotics, Robotics Technician and HomeBrew Robotics.

A hook on a magnet with a flexible adhere
A low center of gravity with elephant ears
Home, Home on the Range
Where the gears and the 2-stage continuous lift elevators play,
Where quickly is heard, 
A suck and chuck type of SCORE!
And the boxes are picked and placed on scales, all day.

Congratulations to the 2018 Systems Design Award winnerâ€¦ 
Team 670, Homestead Robotics With their robot 1 Chainz from Homestead High School!"
